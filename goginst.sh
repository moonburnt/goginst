#wip gog games extractor

##Global settings
scriptname=`basename "$0"`
configfile="$HOME/.config/goginst/config"

##Fallback values. Used if config file doesnt feature any of these (or simply doesnt exist at all)
downloads="." #directory where our downloaded games located
gamedir="./goginst/Games" #directory where game's files will be moved at the end
tempdir="./goginst/temp" #directory where temp files will be located
extractor="./gogextract.py" #path to gogextract.py
delfunc="gio trash" #command used to clean temporary files

##Optional dependencies
inno=true #default = true, if not found on user's system - will be switched to false
gogext=true #default = true, if not found on user's system - will be switched to false

##Functions:
#If directory doesnt exist - shuts whole script down
